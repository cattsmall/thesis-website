As a woman who grew up in a Christian family, I was taught to avoid sex from a very young age. As I grew older, I became afraid of my sexuality. From the Bible to school textbooks, sex was always portrayed in a negative light.

When I became an adult and graduated from college, people suddenly expected me to have sex and be good at it. Even my mother, who previously told me to avoid having sex because of dangerous diseases and emotional stress, said she wouldnâ€™t mind if I got pregnant. Many other people who grew up in Christian families have experienced the same shift in expectations.

Part of growing up to be a healthy human being in our modern society includes having a positive relationship with sex. This project will help people learn about sex in a judgment-free way. Sex has many health benefits; self-understanding is an important part of good sex.
