I will be using Omnigraffle to create diagrams and wireframes. Adobe Illustrator will be my graphics creation tool for this project. Next, I will export the images for use with the game.

For project management, I will use Trello. I will test the game as much as I can using Google Forms.

In terms of building the game, I will use Phaser and export it to Android and iOS using Crosswalk or PhoneGap. All of my code will be version tracked via git and saved on GitHub.
