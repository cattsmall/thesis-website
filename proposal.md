##Statement

SenseU is a game that aims to help young Americans between the ages of 14 and 25 to become more confident in their bodies by understanding how sex works. Despite the fact that sexual activity has many benefits (including lower risk of mortality), many people in America think of sex as a negative activity. This perception is caused by a lack of positive information about sex in schools and on the internet. Religion, specifically Christianity, is a culprit to blame for America's poor relationship with sex. Many schools are taught an abstinence-centered education, and some states have banned adult toys.

Religion heavily affects the way people think about sex and their bodies. About 70% of young people interviewed in a study by the University of Nottingham said they referred to religion every day to make decisions, including about sex. Many religious texts have a negative or nonexistent view of sex. Religious people often feel tension between sex and their beliefs, and some even compartmentalize their lives to feel sexually fulfilled. Even if their desires are considered normal by society, religious people are more likely to self-prohibit when it comes to sex. This feeling is more pronounced in people who are not heterosexual or a part of the gender binary.

America's complicated relationship with sex is influenced by centuries-old ideologies and rules. By unpacking these theories and misconceptions, players can improve the relationship with their own bodies. People need information about sex so they can become more confident and make better decisions.

##Research Overview

###Ray, Darrel. “Sex and God: How Religion Distorts Sexuality”

Christianity and other similar religions can cause many people to have negative relationships with sex because of their asexual ideals. Good sex education leads to happier adults.

> Religion is about restricting sexual choices in the interest of the religion.


> Religion forces people into denying, avoiding, judging and hating themselves and others for their sexual desires and behavior.

> People who learn sex without guilt make better decisions, talk and negotiate more openly with their partners and respect the sexual preferences and desires of others. They enjoy their own bodies and are less jealous, possessive and judgmental.

###Ryan, Christopher. “Sex at Dawn”

Modern sex is completely different from the way humans used to have sex. Our fear of sex and monogamous tendencies were forced on us by religion and the agricultural revolution.

> While hunter-gatherer sex had been modeled on an idea of sharing and complementarity, early agriculturalist sex was voyeuristic, repressive, homophobic, and focused on reproduction.

> Willpower fortified with plenty of guilt, fear, shame, and mutilation of body and soul may provide some control over these urges and impulses. Sometimes. Occasionally. Once in a blue moon. But even when controlled, they refuse to be ignored.

> Modern man’s seemingly instinctive impulse to control women’s sexuality is not an intrinsic feature of human nature. It is a response to specific historical socioeconomic conditions—conditions very different from those in which our species evolved. … It is, as we’ll see, an adaptation to the social world that arose with agriculture.

###Research paper: “The Health Benefits of Sexual Expression”

Sex has many health benefits. We need to change our perception of sex in order to research the benefits of sex more.

###Research paper:  “Religion, Youth and Sexuality”

Many religious young people are conflicted by the choice between obeying their religion and acting on sexual urges.
