I'm currently designing the logic behind the game and figuring out how people would play it.

##General user flow

##Gameplay process

1) Quiz to learn about who you are as a player, generate character

- Select gender (female, male, custom, none)
- How religious are you?
- How often do you go to your house of worship?
- How much do you know about your body?
- How often do you explore your own body?
- How many times have you had sex of any kind with another person?
- How do you feel about sex?

2) Village of people who are ignorant about different things, help them through mini games. Grades?

3) Each section of the village concludes with a final test/quiz thing

4) Over time, you level up by getting good final scores

5) Final boss/test?
