This week was fairly slow, although I worked on character designs and continued writing dialogue.

## Writing progress
Based on the feedback people gave me last week, I managed to cut down on the intro dialogue by over 50%. I also added in a quick tutorial system. I'm continuing to test the game with more people â€“ so far, people seem to like the changes I've made.

### Characters
I wrote more information about the game's characters. This week, I focused on Jade. Next, I'm focusing on Gaiya. See [the Evernote document](https://www.evernote.com/l/AARD89YHqK1HA5WJ36ZfY4cNwBsrbkakeQg) to read my progress so far.

### Story progression
I mapped out the story progression from a user flow standpoint:

## Accountability partner
Lauren helped me troubleshoot my game, which now works on her phone! She also gave me helpful feedback about the amount of intro dialogue in the game.

## Thesis paper
I modified my thesis [abstract (PDF)](/assets/docs/CattSmall_Abstract%23_2015-10-28.pdf) and [conclusion (PDF)](/assets/docs/CattSmall_Conclusion%23_2015-10-28.pdf) this week. Again, I was largely focused on writing dialogue and building the game.

Next, I'll continue building out the first conversation. Woohoo!
