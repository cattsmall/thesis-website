I spent some time tallying longform data from the survey to get an idea of common sentiments people expressed. The following is an ordered list of sentiments gathered from 100 survey responses.

### Common sentiments
1. I enjoy sex.
2. I feel ok/good about my body.
3. I don't like the way my body looks.
4. My religion made me feel guilty about sex & masturbation.
5. I learned what I know from the internet/porn.
6. I want to know how to make sex better and/or do more with my partner.
7. I want to learn more about my body and how sex affects my health.
8. I want to let go and be less stressed about my body during sex.
9. People are awkward about discussing sex.
10. Sex education in schools is inadequate.

These sentiments are helping me come up with quiz questions. Next is game mechanics. This is the hardest part.
