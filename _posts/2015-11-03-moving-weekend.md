I moved this weekend, which meant I didn't have a lot of time for thesis work. Nonetheless, I got some things done!

##Writing progress
I wrote the first draft of [the first conversation](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iH2yS2HZLeinXCdf6s0XlyRmu4BVs2AeYSGTy5FJ4Ek/edit?usp=sharing). The conversation centers around Gaiya's insecurity about sex before marriage.

If you review older posts, you might realize that I switched the conversation from Jade to Gaiya. Unfortunately, I wasn't finding Jade's conversation about looking for partners very compelling or realistic. Gaiya's was much easier to write. I will come back to Jade's conversation later (or completely scrap it if necessary).

###Characters
I wrote more about Gaiya this week. You can look at [the Evernote document](https://www.evernote.com/l/AARD89YHqK1HA5WJ36ZfY4cNwBsrbkakeQg) to read my progress so far.

###Narrative interaction design
Here is a diagram showing the interaction design for transitioning from narrative story to choices:

##Accountability partner
I advised Lauren about her project this week. Hooray for Hack the Flow!

It's a short update this week, sorry! Until next time.
