This week, I answered some questions, outlined my thesis, met with my advisor, and designed conflicts based on my game's curriculum.

##Why, What if, and How
I listened to an episode of Unmistakeable Creative Podcast called "Asking A More Beautiful Question With Warren Berger". Afterward, I answered some important questions. My answers were all quite blunt, to be honest. I didn't find myself inspired to change the project, but the exercise was still helpful.

###Why... is your focus a problem?
It’s a problem because people are being poorly equipped for adulthood.

###Why... are you solving the challenge this way?
I’m solving it this way because games are a fun way to educate people.

###What if... you tried solving it in other ways?
Many other ways already exist. There are sex-positive, educational podcasts. I know of several blogs and webcomics that cover the topic well. Sex-positive events (a la Slut Walk) exist across the country. However, good games about sex are still quite rare.

The only other things I could think of are maybe a web series or conference.

###How... do you make it real?
Get help from others, continue researching and working to build the game.

If I went with a web series, I'd probably make a little animated series using Adobe Premiere.

A conference could go wrong in so many ways, but I'd focus on organizing the event as a set of roundtables about sex, religion, and society.

In the end, I still want to make a game about the subject, but a web series or conference could be interesting in the future.

##Thesis outline
You've seen the curriculum for my game before:

I created an outline based on my thesis curriculum and my previous drafts. You can [read the full, expanded version as a PDF](CattSmall_Outline#_2015-09-16).

1. Introduction
2. Religion, society, and sex
3. Sex-positive sex education through games
4. The game - structure, characters, and levels
5. Conclusion

Each topic will have contain several subtopics. I'll expand on that next week.

I also updated my mind map, as suggested by my thesis professor:

##Advisor meetings
My calendar now has 3 meetings with Frank Lantz's name on it for the next few months! Hurrah! That was easier than expected.

##RA Survey
I'm running a survey for RAs since my game is centered around the life of an RA. Synthesized data to come soon!

##Character + game design ideation
I spent time fleshing out the conflicts characters will have in the game. In addition, I attached it some important pieces of game design. Here are my notes, grabbed straight from Evernote! I'm still working on labeling the characters' conflicts as environmental, interpersonal, or personal.
