This week, I answered some questions, outlined my thesis, met with my advisor, and designed conflicts based on my game's curriculum.

##Why, What if, and How
I listened to an episode of Unmistakeable Creative Podcast called "Asking A More Beautiful Question With Warren Berger". Afterward, I answered some important questions. My answers were all quite blunt, to be honest. I didn't find myself inspired to change the project, but the exercise was still helpful.

###Why... is your focus a problem?
It’s a problem because people are being poorly equipped for adulthood.

###Why... are you solving the challenge this way?
I’m solving it this way because games are a fun way to educate people.

###What if... you tried solving it in other ways?
Many other ways already exist, but good games about the subject do not.

###How... do you make it real?
Get help from others, continue researching and working to build the game.

##Thesis outline
I created an outline based on my thesis curriculum and my previous drafts. [link to downloadable version]

1. Introduction
2. Religion, society, and sex
3. Sex-positive sex education through games
4. The game - structure, characters, and levels
5. Conclusion

Each topic will have contain several subtopics. I'll expand on that next week.

I also updated my mind map, as suggested by my thesis professor. Here it is:

##Advisor meetings
My calendar now has 3 meetings with Frank Lantz's name on it for the next few months! Hurrah! That was easier than expected.

##RA Survey
I'm running a survey for RAs since my game is centered around the life of an RA. Synthesized data to come soon!

##Character + game design ideation
I spent time fleshing out the conflicts characters will have in the game. In addition, I attached it some important pieces of game design. Here are some of my notes, grabbed straight from Evernote! I'm still working on labeling the characters' conflicts as environmental, interpersonal, or personal.
