###Ray, Darrel. “Sex and God: How Religion Distorts Sexuality”

Christianity and other similar religions can cause many people to have negative relationships with sex because of their asexual ideals. Good sex education leads to happier adults.

> Religion is about restricting sexual choices in the interest of the religion.


> Religion forces people into denying, avoiding, judging and hating themselves and others for their sexual desires and behavior.

> People who learn sex without guilt make better decisions, talk and negotiate more openly with their partners and respect the sexual preferences and desires of others. They enjoy their own bodies and are less jealous, possessive and judgmental.

###Ryan, Christopher. “Sex at Dawn”

Modern sex is completely different from the way humans used to have sex. Our fear of sex and monogamous tendencies were forced on us by religion and the agricultural revolution.

> While hunter-gatherer sex had been modeled on an idea of sharing and complementarity, early agriculturalist sex was voyeuristic, repressive, homophobic, and focused on reproduction.

> Willpower fortified with plenty of guilt, fear, shame, and mutilation of body and soul may provide some control over these urges and impulses. Sometimes. Occasionally. Once in a blue moon. But even when controlled, they refuse to be ignored.

> Modern man’s seemingly instinctive impulse to control women’s sexuality is not an intrinsic feature of human nature. It is a response to specific historical socioeconomic conditions—conditions very different from those in which our species evolved. … It is, as we’ll see, an adaptation to the social world that arose with agriculture.
